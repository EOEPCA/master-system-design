[[mainServiceApi,Service API]]
= Service API

The Service API presented by the Exploitation Platform is largely defined and met by the fundamental data/processing services it offers. There are some additional meta-services that support the clients in the discovery and usage of these core services. The Service API defined in this section seeks to define a standard set of interfaces against which the Client Library can be developed and that can be relied upon for platform-to-platform interoperability.

[[platformCapabilities]]
== Platform Capabilities

Provides a single well-known 'bootstrap' URL through which the service capabilities and their endpoints can be discovered:

* Declare platform capabilities
* Discover service endpoints
* Core platform data/processing services
* Additional meta-services to support clients
* Used by <<mainClientLibrary>> to initialise its platform interfaces
* Used by <<mainProcEMS, EMS>> to match service/application dependencies with platform capabilities
* Used by other platforms to establish interoperability
