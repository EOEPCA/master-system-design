== Functional Overview

In the context of the Common Architecture, User Management covers the following main functional areas:

Identity and Access Management (IAM)::
Identification/authentication of users and authorization of access to protected resources (data/services) within the EP.

Accounting and Billing::
Maintaining an accounting record of all user accesses to data/compute/services/applications, supported by appropriate systems of credits and billing.

User Profile::
Maintenance of details associated to the user that may be needed in support of access management and billing.

These are explored in the following sub-sections.

[[IAM,Identity and Access Management]]
=== Identity and Access Management (IAM)

The solution for IAM is driven by the need for Federated Identity and Authorization in the context of a network of collaborating exploitation platforms and connected services. This federated environment should facilitate an end-user experience in which they can use a single identity across collaborating platforms *(Single Sign-On)*, they can bring their own existing identity to the platforms *('Login With' service)*, and platforms can access the federated services of other platforms on behalf of the end-user *(delegated access and authorization)*.

The goal of IAM is to uniquely identify the user and limit access to protected resources to those having suitable access rights. We assume an Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) approach in which authorization decisions are made based upon access policies/rules that define attributes required by resources and possessed (as claims) by users. ABAC is is seen as a more flexible approach than Role Base Access Control (RBAC), affording the ability to express more sophisticated authorizations rules beyond the role(s) of the user - and noting the fact that a role-based ruleset could be implemented within an attribute based approach, (i.e. RBAC is a subset/specialisation of ABAC).

In achieving this there are three main concerns:

* Unique user identification
* Determine the access policy applicable to the resource
* From the access policy determine:
** what attributes are required to access the protected resource
** whether the user has the required attributes

For the Common Architecture, we establish separation of User Identification from Access Management. User identity is federated and handled external to the platform. Within the Network of EO Resources, resources held within an exploitation platform are made available to federated partner platforms. Authorization policy is enforced within the platform at point of access, but the access policy can be federated within the network of EO resources, leading to a system of _federated authorization_.

* The identity is provided externally. The external IdP has no association to the exploitation platform, and hence is not the appropriate place to administer attributes that relate to EP resources
* The protected resources are under the custodianship of the exploitation platform and hence the exploitation platform enforces the access policy decision
* The administrative domain for an access policy should should not be tied to an exploitation platform, which facilitates the provision of federation and virtual organisations

Federation of services between exploitation platforms is an important goal of the Common Architecture. Thus, the IAM design must offer an approach through which user access is managed between platforms, ensuring proper enforcement of access controls and billing.

<<img_iamOverview>> presents the basic approach. At this stage it does not consider the case in which an exploitation platform accesses resources in another platform on behalf of a user, (for example a workflow step that is invoked on another platform). This is addressed in a later section. Users are authenticated by redirection to an external identity provider, (their ‘home’ IdP). This returns the authentication decision and some basic user information as required (such as name, email, etc.).

[#img_iamOverview,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.Identity and Access Management Overview
image::iam-overview.png[width=100%,pdfwidth=100%,align="center"]

Each protected resource is fronted by its Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), which acts as filter that will only permit access if the appropriate conditions are met. This decision is made according to a set of rules that are under the control of and configured within the exploitation platform.

The Login Service is provided as a common component that is utilised by each PEP to perform the authentication flow with the external IdPs. In the case of an unauthenticated request that requires authentication, the PEP will initiate the Login Service by redirection of the User’s originating request. The successful flow ultimately redirects back to the PEP and so maintains the direct connection between the end-user agent and the resource server. An alternative approach would be the use of an API Gateway to perform the role of the PEP, acting as an intermediary between the end-user agent and the resource server. However, this would have the effect of proxying the connection which can have an impact on data transfer performance, which is of particular importance in the case of significant data volumes being returned to the User.

The PEP interrogates the PDP for an authorization decision. The PEP sends a request that indicates the pertinent details of the attempted access, including:

* Identity of end-user (subject)
* The API (path/version etc.) being accessed (resource)
* The operation (HTTP verb) being performed (action)

The Policy Decision Point (PDP) returns an authorization decision based upon details provided in the request, and the applicable authorization policy. The authorization policy may delegate all or part of the decision to external PDP(s) within the federated network. This represents a Federated Authorization model and facilitates a model of shared resources and virtual organisations.

The authorization policy defines a set of rules and how they should be evaluated to determine the policy decision. The rules are expressed through attributes. The policy is evaluated to determine what attributes are required, and what attributes the user possesses. This evaluation extends through external PDPs according to any federated authorization defined in the policy.

It should be additionally noted that the decision to allow the user access depends upon dynamic 'attributes', such as whether the user has enough credits to 'pay' for their usage, or whether they have accepted the necessary Terms & Conditions for a given dataset or service. Thus, the PDP must interrogate other EP-services such as 'Accounting & Billing' and 'User Profile' to answer such questions.

<<img_iamOverviewFlow>> provides an overview of the IAM Flow, (success case).

.IAM Overview Flow

*Flows marked \<<redirect>> should be interpreted as flows between services that are made by redirection through the User Agent.* For brevity, the interface between the Login Service, the User Agent and the External IdPs is simplified in <<img_iamOverviewFlow>> - they are expanded in section <<mainAuthenticatedIdentity>>. It should also be noted that the flows with the External IdP will vary according to the protocol required by the External IdP, (e.g. OAuth, SAML, etc.).

[[mainAuthenticatedIdentity]]
=== Authentication

The approach to user identity and authentication centres around the use of OpenID Connect. Each Exploitation Platform maintains their own OIDC Provider through which tokens can be issued to permit access to protected resources within the EP. The authentication itself is delegated to external Identity Providers at the preference of the end-user wishing to reuse their existing identity provision.

*Authenticated Identity*

The Login Service is an OpenID Connect Provider that provides a ‘Login With’ service that allows the platform to support multiple external identity providers. The Login Service acts as a Relying Party in its interactions with the external IdPs to establish the authenticated identity of the user through delegated authentication.

The Login Service presents an OIDC Provider interface to its clients, through which the OIDC clients can obtain Access Tokens to resources. The access tokens are presented by the clients in their requests to resource servers (intercepted by PEP). The PEP (acting on behalf of the resource server) relies upon the access token to establish the authenticated identity of the users making the requests. Once the user identity is established, then the PEP can continue with its policy decision (deferred to the PDP).

Thus, clients of the EP must act as OIDC Clients in order to authenticate their users to the platform, before invoking its services. Clients include the web applications that provide the UI of the exploitation platform, as well as other external applications/systems (including other exploitation platforms) wishing to use the services of the EP.

The Login Service must act as client (Relying Party) to each of the External IdPs to be supported and offered as a ‘Login With’ option. The interface/flow with the External IdP is integrated into the OIDC flow implemented by the Login Service. This includes prompting the user to discover their ‘home’ Identity provider. The interactions with the external IdP represents the ‘user authentication step’ within the OIDC flows. Completion of a successful authentication with the external IdP allows the Login Service to issue the requested access tokens (depending on the flow used).

<<img_iamAuthenticationFlow>> illustrates the basic user access flow, invoked through a web browser.

[#img_iamAuthenticationFlow,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.IAM Authentication Flow (Browser)
image::iam-authentication-flow.png[width=100%,pdfwidth=100%,align="center"]

*Federated User Access*

Based upon the above authentication model, an EP could access the resources of another EP by obtaining an access token through OIDC flows. However, considering that these EP->EP invocations will typically be Machine-to-machine (M2M), then we need to consider how the end-user (resource owner) is able to complete their consent. Two possibilities are explored in the subsequent sections:

. The user pre-authorizes the EP->EP access in advance of the operation
. Use of OIDC JWKS for trusted federation of identity between platforms

*User Pre-authorization*

Using the facilities of the Exploitation Platform, the user (perhaps via their User Profile management console) initiates the authorization flow from one EP to another. The end result is that the originating EP obtains delegated access to another EP on behalf of the user - with the resulting access tokens being maintained within the user's profile on the EP.

At the point where the EP needs to access a resource on another EP, then the access tokens are obtained from the user's profile and used as Bearer token in the resource request to the other EP. Refresh tokens can be used to ensure that authorization is long-lived.

Conversly, the user's profile at a given EP should also provide the ability to manage any inward authrosations they have granted to other EPs, i.e. ability to revoke a previous authorization by invalidating the refresh token. This would invole interface with the Login Service.

*Possible use of OIDC JWKS Federation*

OIDC provides a distributed key-hierarchy that could be used to support federated user access between collaborating exploitation platforms. The concept is explored in this section.

Reference: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html

OIDC provides a framework in which RPs and OPs can dynamically establish verifiable trust chains, and so share keys to support signing and validation of JWTs.

Dedicated ‘federation’ endpoints are defined that allow an entity (such as RP or OP) to publish their own Entity Statements, and to obtain Statements for other entities that are issued by trusted third-parties within the federation. The metadata/signatures within the Entity Statements establish a chain of trust that can be followed to known (trusted) Trust Anchors, and so the Entity Statements and the included entity public keys can be trusted.

Thus, through this mechanism public keys can be shared to underpin the signing and validation of JWTs.

Within an EP, when a resource server is executing a user’s request, it may need to invoke a resource in another EP with which it is collaborating. The resource access to the other EP must be made on behalf of the originating user.

The nominal solution is for the originating EP to act as an OIDC Client to interface with the Login Service of the other EP, and so obtain the access token required to access the other resource. In this case, we should consider the fact that the resource access may be asynchronous to the end-user request and is not made within the context of the end-user’s user agent. Therefore, we should explore possibilities (flows) provided by OIDC/OAuth that support this type of access.

One possibility is to make use of the signed-JWT ID Token that can be carried through the calls into and across resource servers. Through the facilities provided by JSON Web Key Set (JWKS), ID Tokens can be verified and trusted by other platforms operating within the same JWKS key hierarchy.

Thus, using the trusted ID Token, it may be possible follow an OIDC/OAuth flow from one EP to another, in which the user is deemed to have a-priori authorized the third-party access. At this point it is only the user’s identity that has been established, with the authorization decision subject to the rules of the PDP/PEP of the remote system. The identified user must have appropriate a-priori permissions (attributes) on the target resources to be granted access, (ref. ‘Federated Attributes’).

Thus, it is the ID of the user that has been passed machine-to-machine to facilitate the service federation. This effectively achieves cross-EP single sign-on, without relying upon the user agent of the end-user providing cookies to the other EP.

[[mainBilling,Accounting and Billing]]
=== Accounting and Billing

The platform must account for resource use both within the platform and in other platforms via federation. In addition, several inter-platform billing models are supported as defined in the use cases, <<EOEPCA-UC>>. A number of principles must first be established:

* Actions are performed within the context of a 'billing identity', which may be different to the user's identity.
* Charges are the result of discrete 'billing events' occuring within a particular 'billing window'. Pricing must consider all events within the window, not events individually (to support, for example, tiered pricing).
* Different platforms may follow completely different pricing and billing models. The architecture and federation messaging cannot assume any particular method of calculation or for describing prices.
* Only the platform hosting it can accurately price the use of a licensed Resource or compute resource.
* Costs may be estimated but the estimate is not required to be binding. Federated access can never rely on binding estimates.
* Debts can only be created where there is a direct contractual relationship and opportunity for credit control. A user can never owe money directly to another platform unless he has an account with it.
* A platform prices in a single currency (but could choose to allow a user to settle a bill with another currency). Different federated platforms may choose different currencies.

*Billing Identities*

A billing identity is a user identity for a user who has established a billing relationship with the platform. A billing user may delegate chargeable service access to other users within the system, permitting that user to use resources billed to the billing identity.

Individual platforms may choose models with varying complexity. For example, one platform may require that the billing and user identity are always the same, whilst another may permit a user working on multiple cross-organizational projects to choose the billing identity to use. Identities may be related to organizations, projects, etc, for access control and credit control purposes - but these relationships are not required by the architecture.

As required by their purpose, cross-platform messaging will include both the user id and the relevant billing identity.

NOTE: Both the billing and user identities, and other information such as the location of each one and the type of organization involved, may be relevant to determining prices. This is because the place of supply for VAT purposes must be determined, plus any discounts for, for example, academic use. Note that 'location' means more than 'country' (eg, the Canary Islands have lower VAT than Madrid). Also, some organizations may be treated differently such as international organizations exempt from all tax.

*Commercially Licensed Resources*

Users may publish Resources which are licensed to others on commercial terms and use the platform to collect payments. There are two types of charges which require support within User Management: time-based and volume-based.

Time-based charges occur when a user requests a licence which costs a fixed price for a fixed time (or is permanent), regardless of the accesses made to the Resource. The Data Access Services and Execution Management Services determine when such a licence is required and the licence manager manages the process for buying one, including emitting a billing event. This typically will happen in advance of a request. The licence manager may give the billing service an opportunity to reject the request, if applicable to the platform's billing model.

Volume-based charges occur as access to a licensed Resource proceeds or completes (for example, on first access to a specific satellite image or for each input image passed to a commercial machine learning model). Again, the licence manager reports these as billing events when a licence requirements check is made.

Pricing is specified by the Licenser (in a particular form supported by the platform) and stored by the pricing engine (quantity to price mapping) and licence manager (method for determining which licences and 'quantity'). The licence manager must emit three billing events when license grants are bought: a charge to the user, a credit to the Licenser and a charge to the Licenser representing the platform fee for handling payment processing.

*Budgets*

#TBD#

*Inter-platform Payments*

Three different models for federated availability of commercial services are supported, two of which require support from the accounting and billing mechanisms of the platforms involved. This support comes in the form of inter-platform payments, allowing users to pay for executions or Resource licences which are located elsewhere in the federation.

Note that _three_ platforms may be involved in providing a chargeable federated commercial service:

* The home platform where the user is registered and the action is initiated.
* The host platform where the licenced Resource or chargeable compute resource is located.
* The compute platform where processing occurs.

Consider, for example, a processing chain invoked on the home platform which invokes a processing service running on the compute platform using a software container published by a Licenser registered on the host platform. Frequently, two or more of these platforms are the same. However, even if all three are the same the platform may wish to use the same process where payments to a Licenser are involved.

*Inter-platform Payment Model and Process*

An inter-platform payment supports a User of one platform paying for a service provided by either another platform or by a User of another platform. It's important to repeat that a debt is only ever created between two entities which have a legal relationship and an opportunity for credit control. This requires that inter-platform payments involve two or three separate debts being: one from User to home platform, one from home platform to the host platform and the third from the host platform to the User providing the service (if any). The process must also cope with the price not being known in advance in all cases - processing costs in particular may be unpredictable. To support this, the following stages are involved:

* *Authorization stage*: This provides an opportunity for credit control decisions in advance of debts being incurred. This establishes a maximum amount of debt before a new authorization must be sought or the operation aborted but will not necessarily ever be owed in full. Both home and host platform must agree to authorize an inter-platform payment (the host platform may reject if it doesn't believe the home platform will pay). The home platform may 'hold' some account credit from its user or authorize a credit card payment if appropriate in its billing model.
* *Clearing stage*: This occurs after a debt is legally incurred, such as after (some of) the computation or data access is completed. The platform on which the service is provided, the host platform, reports to the home platform how much debt has actually been incurred. It may happen in stages - for example a large authorization may occur, followed by the clearing of smaller amounts after every hour of compute time. It cannot exceed the amount authorized.
* *Settlement stage*: This involves a batch of multiple payments, such as a day or a month of payments. The platforms with payment processing contracts in place must reconcile their records and calculate a net amount owed (potentially in multiple currencies). They must then settle the net debt by making a payment using the banking system.

Two different commercial models are supported: bilateral clearing and central clearing. In bilateral clearing every platform must negotiate a contract with every other platform (or as far as possible - incomplete coverage will limit what users can do). This has certain commercial downsides, such as a need for every-pair auditing for accurate reporting of resource use and a danger of incumbents excluding new entrants. In central clearing a clearing house must exist and all platforms form a relationship with the clearing house. The clearing house technical functionality is not further explored here, nor is the management of counterparty risk. The messaging and process is intended to be the same in both models.

Where inter-platform payments are used the host platform is acting a subcontractor to the home platform. Should the host platform fail to perform, a dispute resolution process must be used. This is considered out of scope of the architecture, except that payments may be marked as disputed, refunded or charged back. This must be accounted for during reconciliation between platforms.

*Federated Commercial Services Without Inter-platform Payments: Direct Payments*

If inter-platform payments are not available, for example because two platforms do not have a payment agreement, it may still be possible to provide services across multiple platforms providing the user has an account and billing relationship with each one directly. This requires that both platforms recognize both the user and the selected billing identity, and that the billing user has delegated access to the user in both platforms.

To handle direct payments the user must authorize the home platform to act on its behalf when submitting requests to the host platform. This is done using OAuth. The home platform must redirect the user to the host platform which then returns an authorization token to the home platform. Federated platforms must run an OAuth endpoint for this purpose and certain restrictions must be put on its functioning (for example on refresh token lifetime).

Other system components must then use an access token when making requests to the host platform. The host platform should still report costs and identifiers to the home platform, which must be passed to the Billing Service to be recorded. This aids dispute resolution and the reporting of total costs for particular requests.

*Estimating Inter-platform Costs*

#TBD#

*Relationship to System Components*

The Billing Service handles inter-platform payments and supports direct payments in response to requests from other components, such as the EMS. The direct payment model is very different to inter-platform payments but knowledge of the distinction and when each should be used should be isolated in the Billing Service as much as possible.

To support this for volume-based charges, interaction between other system components and the Billing Service proceeds as follows:

* Prior to federated resource use, a component must make a request to the Billing Service with the estimated cost (or a fixed value if not available) and the identity of the host platform. It must also include the transaction ID for the user action which resulted in the payment.
* The Billing Service determines what kind of payment handling is available, if any. It returns success or failure and, optionally, an OAuth URL to authorize direct payment.
* The component proceeds with its activity, incurring charges. The activity occurs on the compute platform, which may also be the home or host platform.
* The compute platform seeks authorization from the host platform before charges are incurred. The host platform checks that an authorized payment exist (directly between the home and host platform). If the charge is for compute resources then these are the same platform and may be a no-op, but this may not be the case for computation using licensed data or software.
* If the compute platform seeks access from a host platform which has no authorized payment in place then it must report this to the home platform. The home platform may then request authorization or abort the processing. This may happen if the home platform cannot fully predict the accesses made during computation.
* The compute platform computes, incurring charges. The compute platform may also access the host platform to retrieve data or software but this may also be cached. The resource use is reported by the compute platform to the host platform - for example, a list of images accessed or processed. This happens in multiple chunks when charges are incurred over time.
* The host platform clears pieces of the original inter-platform authorization by sending a clearing request directly to the home platform. Note that only the host platform is considered authoritative for calculating the true cost (which is returned here).
* If the original authorization is exhausted then the home platform may pre-emptively extend it by creating a new payment (with the same transaction ID). Otherwise the host platform must reply to a charge report from the compute platform with a response prohibiting further charges.
* On receiving such a message the compute platform must suspend further processing and forward the response to the home platform. The home platform must then either seek a new authorization or send an abort message to the compute platform.

For time-based licences the flow can be simpler:

* The component requests payment authorization from the Billing Service, specifying an exact price.
* The component communicates with the host platform to acquire the licence.
* The host platform sends a payment clearing message to the home platform Billing Service to clear the entire authorization.

*Payment Processing Systems*

Payment processing itself, in particular card payment processing, may be initiated by the Billing Service but should be strictly separate from it. <<PCI-DSS>> imposes many onerous requirements not just on the software and hardware used for payment processing, but also on the wider organization and its processes (for example, for formal change reviews and code reviews, the use of specialist cryptographic hardware security modules, the separation of duties between staff and requirements in recruitment and training). For these reasons some implementers will need to avoid card processing within the system entirely and redirect users to externally hosted payment servers. This may constrain them to an account credit-based model whilst other providers may be able to initiate an authorization or full payment on-demand.

=== User Management

The User Profile is a system resource that maintains a set of data for each user including:

* User details
* Terms and conditions accepted by the user
* Licence keys held by the user
* User API key management

The User Profile for a given user is tied to the unique identifier provided by their Home-IdP through the authentication process.


=== Licence and T&C Management

A licence manager must determine whether or not licence requirements permit certain actions by a certain user. For freely available resources simple acceptance of the licence may be necessary. For commercially licensed resources it may be much more complicated. For example, a licence may have been bought for non-educational use by up to 5 users for satellite images with a certain resolution and area, with an extra charge made for images less than 15 degrees off nadir. Alternatively, a commercially licensed processing service may be charged by the CPU-hour or user-month. This is handled by the pricing and billing services, but acceptance of these terms must still be made first.

Some concepts applicable within the licence manager must be established:

* A licence consist of the legal text itself, a name and version, a description of pricing where appropiate and other metadata.
* A licence terms acceptance is the acceptance by a particular user (and organization) of the licence terms and conditions.
* A licence grant grants a users access to particular parts of a resource or for particular purposes. This is only applicable to commercial licensed resources. A licence grant is signed by the licenser.
* The licence manager does not know which resources require which licences. It only knows data about identified licences and about which users have which acceptances and grants.

The licence manager does not formally know how to calculate the price of a commercial licence grant. Instead, it produces an identifier for a particular type of grant and a quantity. The billing engine turns this in to a price, which may involve applying any user-specific or volume-based discounts. The quantity may be in, for example, square kilometres. Alternatively, the licences may be priced at €1/unit, effectively transferring responsibility to the licence manager's configuration.

Note that licencers must ensure that their licences are uniquely identified across the whole federation. That is, if they use the same licence on multiple platforms they must give it the same ID and must not otherwise reuse IDs.

*Licence Requirement Checks*

At the request planning stage the EMS determines the licences required (as far as is possible in advance). This results in a list of licence requirement specifications. These may vary in complexity, from simply identifying a dataset to specifying an AoI, ToI and additional attributes, depending on platform support and on any knowledge the EMS has about which request fields are licence-relevant. The licence manager, however, only performs matching of these against rules or configuration using no or limited knowledge of the specific meaning of fields.

On receiving licence requirement specifications, the licence manager must compare them against the licences and grants possessed by the user and determine what licences, if any, must be obtained by the user before the action is permitted. On failure, the result should contain something the user can act on, such as a URL for viewing and agreeing to dataset terms or for buying licences. On success, the licence manager may return information on which fields were used so that the EMS can avoid repeated checks.

The licence manager should also be able to determine when additional commercial licence grants should be added (and charged for) automatically. The user must have previously agreed to the license terms and pricing. When a new licence grant is added it should record it and issue a billing event.

Licence grants may also be managed by an external service operated by the licenser. This communication is managed entirely by the licence manager.

Processing may cross platform boundaries within the federation. A platform executing processing or supplying a resource must be able to determine that the processing is running in a context in which any required licences are available. To support this, the context must include enough information to identify the licence manager of the originating platform. When a licence manager receives a licence requirement specification which can't be satisfied locally it should use this endpoint to perform a licence requirement check. The originating platform may fail this request, may accept it based on existing data (returning signed licence grants if appropriate) or may perform an automated licence grant acquisition. The host/compute platform may then store these licence grants against the user ID for use in future checks.

Note that cross-platform executions may involve running, for example, a processing chain initiated from platform A with a component involving a commercially licenced compute service from platform B running on platform C. In these cases platform B may check that the user has accepted its platform acceptable use policy by contacting platform A, fetch the compute service from platform C which will then also directly contact platform A to ensure that licences are available before returning the container ot platform B.

TODO: Diagrams!


*Licence Acquisition*

Unless managed by an external service, users must be able to view and accept terms and purchase licence grants using the licence manager. For licences where no licence grants must be bought this is very simple - for example, the licence manager may provide APIs enabling the UI to fetch licence text and submit acceptance. This can be done from a resource information display page or following a refused request.

Where a licence grant must be bought the flow for the user is managed by other components. A user interface may be used to choose licence attributes or particular subsets of data, for example, or a user may have the option to allow automatic purchases as data is accessed. This licence manager must support this functionality in the following ways:

* A human-readable description of the pricing model and prices is included with the licence metadata. This should be displayed to the user.
* The licence manager can accept a licence requirement specification and turn it in to either a product code and quantity (which the caller can then pass to the pricing engine) or information on which additional fields are required. The field names, types and UI information is supplied by other services as part of the resource definition.
* The licence manager can accept a command to buy a specified licence. It will then emit a billing event. This may happen synchronously or asynchronously depending on the needs of the platform's billing model.

When federated access is involved, such as when a processing chain runs some components on another platform or when data or processing services are transferred to run locally, a user may need to accept licence terms or acquire a licence grant for a resource which is not published via the home platform. This must always be initiated from the home platform, either in advance of the execution or in response to an event returned by a host platform. For terms acceptance the licence manager must contact the host platform and transfer the necessary T&C data. For a (commercial) licence grant, the licence manager must ask the billing manager to authorize a payment to the host platform and then make a request to the host licence manager to buy the licence (specifying the payment ID). The host licence manager must verify the price before asking its own billing manager to clear the payment. It should then record the licence grant as well as returning it to the home platform.


*Licence Administration*

Resource owners must be able to configure licences. The UIs and APIs allowing them to do this must interact with the licence manager (and the pricing engine) to configure their licences. This includes only the licences themselves - assignment of licence requirements to resources is out of the licence manager's scope.

*Porting Licences Within the Federation*

In some cases users may have multiple home platforms, initiating some workloads from different locations. To ensure that users can use their licences for workloads initiated across all locations licence 'porting' may be used.

A user 'ports' a licence from one platform to another by using OAuth to authorize the licence manager on the local platform to access his licences on another. This is only permitted if the licences have been marked as 'portable' by the licenser.


This mechanism may be used for two purposes. In the first, a publisher has published his Resource in both platforms (which may be done to permit lower processing latencies, lower payment processing costs or the use of proprietary features). The platform receiving the licence must verify its signature using the licenser's public key before accepting it. In the second case the Resource is not available on the receiving platform but may still be used in cross-platform workflows (including the case when a processing service is transferred from a remote host platform to execute locally).
