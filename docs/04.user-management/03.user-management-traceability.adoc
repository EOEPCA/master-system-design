| EOEPCA-UC-0206 | The EP can filter or mark Resource search results and information display based on user account data (eg, licences purchased, academic vs commercial user) and Resource access rules / ownership | Login Service, PEP, PDP | EOEPCAUM-TP-LOG-0050 EOEPCAUM-TP-PEP-0040 EOEPCAUM-TP-PDP-00X0
| EOEPCA-UC-0207 | The EP can refuse access to some or all aspects of a Resource based on the User and Resource (eg, show summary or search result but not allow data access, documentation access or visualization) | Login Service, PEP, PDP | EOEPCAUM-TP-LOG-0050 EOEPCAUM-TP-PEP-0020 EOEPCAUM-TP-PEP-0040 EOEPCAUM-TP-PDP-00X0
| EOEPCA-UC-0212 | The EP can request, record and display acceptance of identified T&Cs by a User (noting that a User may have to accept T&Cs more than once if he represents multiple organizations) | License Manager | Planned for Release 2.0
| EOEPCA-UC-0213 | The EP can prevent access to Resources when T&C acceptance is required and not completed and can prompt the user to do this (note: this access may happen inside a UI, API or executing processing service) | License Manager| Planned for Release 2.0
| EOEPCA-UC-0221 | Use of Resources (including search, metadata display, costing, download and execution, but not modification of resources) still functions in as high-performance and uniform a way as possible even when the Resources are located on other platforms within the federation (and access and ownership rules are still enforced) | All | EOEPCAUM-TP-PEP-0010 EOEPCAUM-TP-PEP-0040 EOEPCAUM-TP-PDP-00X0
| EOEPCA-UC-0405 | The EP can establish federation with remote peer platforms for the purpose of invoking processing platform->platform | Login Service, PDP | EOEPCAUM-TP-LOG-0010 EOEPCAUM-TS-PDP-0060
| EOEPCA-UC-0507 | An interactive application can access the platform APIs (eg to run Processing Services) under the delegated credentials of the Consumer | Login Service, PEP, PDP | Planned for Release 2.0
| EOEPCA-UC-1002 | The API is programming-language agnostic and accessible to non-professional programmers and scientists | Login Service, PDP, PEP| EOEPCAUM-TP-PEP-0050 EOEPCAUM-TP-PDP-0040
| EOEPCA-UC-1003 | API clients are provided for popular programming languages within the EO domain, eg Python | um-common-libraries | N/A

| EOEPCA-UC-1005 | An API authentication method suitable for use with scientist-written ad-hoc scripts is provided, eg API keys | Login Service, PEP, PDP, License Manager | Planned for Release 2.0
| EOEPCA-UC-1303 | An Expert User can create Interactive Applications which are implemented using server-side infastructure which is not managed as dedicated resources within an application session - for example, an Interactive Development Environment consisting of JupyterHub and Kubernetes cluster all shared between all users. The application will still be able to use delegated credentials for data access. | Login Service, PEP, PDP | Planned for Release 2.0
| EOEPCA-UC-1506 | Access to platform facilities (which may include remote platforms) by the code under development will use the user's credentials and be subject to normal access constraints (eg, T&Cs) | Login Service, PEP, PDP | Planned for Release 2.0
| EOEPCA-UC-1701 | A Licenser who has published Resources in the catalogue on a commercial basis can specify an API endpoint which will be contacted to authorize access to those Resources or can specify a list of permitted user IDs | Login Service, PEP, PDP | Planned for Release 2.0
| EOEPCA-UC-1702 | The platform can restrict use of a Resource based on this API endpoint, including time or volume limits after which access must be re-authorized | Login Service, PEP, PDP | Planned for Release 2.0
| EOEPCA-UC-1705 | The Licenser's sales site can use an authentication protocol (such as OpenID Connect) to authenticate buyers using their EP credentials, and also to avoid a need to log in for users already logged in to the EP | License Manager | Planned for Release 2.0
| EOEPCA-UC-1707 | A User submitting processing to run on another EP must authorize the home platform to access his host platform account's compute resources (eg using oAuth) | Login Service | Planned for Release 2.0
| EOEPCA-UC-1810 | A User can agree to the T&Cs and prices and, if platform payment is fully authorized, will be granted access | Login Service, License Manager, Billing Service, Pricing Engine | Planned for Release 2.0
| EOEPCA-UC-1817 | The home platform can 'hold' some of the credit in the User's account following platform payment authorization, if required by its billing model | Billing Service, Pricing Engine | Planned for Release 2.0
