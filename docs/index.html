<p>The Master System Design provides an EO Exploitation Platform architecture that meets the service needs of current and future systems, as defined by the use cases described in <a href="#EOEPCA-UC">[EOEPCA-UC]</a>. These use cases must be explored under 'real world' conditions by engagement with existing deployments, initiatives, user groups, stakeholders and sponsors within the user community and within overlapping communities, in order to gain a fully representative understanding of the functional requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The system design takes into consideration existing precursor architectures (such as the Exploitation Platform Functional Model <a href="#EP-FM]">[EP-FM]]</a> and Thematic Exploitation Platform Open Architecture <a href="#TEP-OA">[TEP-OA]</a>), including consideration of state-of-the-art technologies and approaches used by current related projects. The master system design describes functional blocks linked together by agreed standardised interfaces.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The importance of the OGC in these activities is recognised as a reference for the appropriate standards and in providing mechanisms to develop and evolve standards as required in the development of the architecture. In order to meet the design challenges we must apply the applicable existing OGC standards to the full set of federated use cases in order to expose deficiencies and identify needed evolution of the standards. Standards are equally important in all areas of the Exploitation Platform, including topics such as Authentication &amp; Authorisation Infrastructure (AAI), containerisation and provisioning of virtual cloud resources to ensure portability of compute between different providers of resource layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Data and metadata are fundamental considerations for the creation of an architecture in order to ensure full semantic interoperability between services. In this regard, data modelling and the consideration of data standards are critical activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The system design must go beyond the provision of a standalone EO Exploitation Platform, by intrinsically supporting federation of similar EO platforms at appropriate levels of the service stack.  The Network of EO Resources seeks, âto unite the available - but scattered - European resources in a large federated and open environmentâ. In such a context, federation provides the potential to greatly enhance the utilization of data and services and provide as stimulus for research and commercial exploitation. From the end-user point of view, the federated system should present itself as a single consolidated environment in which all the federated resources are made available as an integrated system. Thus, the system design must specify federation-level interfaces that support this data and service-level interoperability in such a way that is seamless to the end users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal is to create an Integrated Data Exploitation Environment. Users will apply their workflows close to the hosted data, supplemented by their own data. Processing outputs may be hosted as new products that can themselves contribute to the global catalogue. This paradigm can then be extended to encompass the federated set of Exploitation Platforms within the Network of EO Resources. The result is a Federated, Integrated Data Analysis Environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Reference Implementation of the full architecture will be developed to prove the concepts and also to provide an off-the-shelf solution that can be instantiated by future projects to implement their EO Exploitation Platform, thus facilitating their ability to join the federated Network of EO Resources. <strong>Thus, the Reference Implementation can be regarded as a set of re-usable platform services, in the context of a re-usable platform architecture.</strong></p>

<p>The overall system design has been considered by taking the âExploitation Platform â Functional Modelâ <a href="#EP-FM">[EP-FM]</a> as a starting point and then evolving these ideas in the context of existing interface standards (with some emphasis on the OGC protocol suite) and the need for federated services.</p>

<h3 id="_domain_areas">3.1. Domain Areas</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The system architecture is designed to meet the use cases as defined in <a href="#EOEPCA-UC">[EOEPCA-UC]</a> and <a href="#EP-FM">[EP-FM]</a>. <a href="#EOEPCA-UC">[EOEPCA-UC]</a> makes a high-level analysis of the use-cases to identify the main system functionalities organised into domain areas: 'User Management', 'Processing &amp; Chaining' and 'Resource Management'. The high-level functionalities are often met by more than one domain area, and User Management (specifically Identity &amp; Access Management) cuts across all use cases, and forms the basis of all access control restrictions that are applied to platform services and data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<p>A potential federation concept is represented by interactions between corresponding blocks in a collaborating Platform âBâ. The architecture aims to minimise dependencies and is conducive to the principle of subcontracting the implementation to experts in the respective domains. The web portal integrates various client components to form a rich user-facing interface. <strong>The Web Portal is depicted as it has interfaces with the other domain areas - but it is not a priority concern for the Common Architecture. Each exploitation platform would be expected to develop its own web interfaces according to its needs.</strong></p>

Resource consumption may also be controlled e.g. by credits and/or quotas associated with the user account. In the Network of EO Resources, a user should not need to create an account on multiple platforms. Therefore some interactions will be required between the User Management functions, whether directly or in directly via trusted third party.</p>

<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Resource Tier</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Resource Tier represents the hosting infrastructure and provides the EO data, storage and compute upon which the exploitation is deployed.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Platform Tier</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Platform Tier represents the Exploitation Platform and the services it offers to end-users. The layers comprising the Platform Tier are further described below.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Exploitation Tier</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Exploitation Tier represents the end-users who exploit the services of the platform to perform analysis, or using high-level applications built-in on top of the platform&#8217;s services.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Exploitation Platform builds upon the services provided by the hosting infrastructure - specifically accessing its data holding and using its compute resources. The components providing the EP services are deployed within the compute offering, with additional compute resources being provisioned on-demand to support end-user analysis activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The EP&#8217;s services access the data resources through a Data Access Gateway that provides an abstraction of the data access interface provided by the resource tier. This abstraction provides a 'standard' data access semantic that can be relied upon by other EP services - thus isolating specific data access concerns of the resource tier to a single EP component.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Processing Framework provides the environment through which processing services and applications are executed in support of end-user analysis activities. It might be envisiaged that some built-in (common) processing functions are provided, but the main focus of the processing framework is to support deployment and execution of bespoke end-user processing algorithms, and interactive analysis. Access to the underlying data from the executing processes is marshalled through the Data Access Gateway and its supporting Data Access Library.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The EP provides a Data Catalogue, so that end-users can discover and browse the data available for inclusion in their analysis. Similarly an Application Catalogue provides this discovery service for processing services and applications available within the platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Data Services based upon open standards serve the clients of the Exploitation Platform for data access and data visualisation. Access to the underlying data is made via the Data Access Gateway.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Service API represents the public service interfaces exposed by the Exploitation Platform for consumption by its clients. Covering all aspects of the EP (authentication, data/processing discovery, processing etc.), these interfaces are based upon open standards and are designed to offer a consistent EP service access semantic within the network of EO resources. Use of the network (HTTP) interfaces of the Service API is facilitated by the Client Library that provides bindings for common languages (Python, R, Javascript). The Client Library is a programmtic representation of the Service API which acts as an abstraction of the Exploitation Platform and so facilitates the development of portable client implementations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Exploitation Tier hosts the web clients with which the end-user interacts to conduct their analysis/exploitation activities. These clients would typically utilise the Client Library in their implementation. The Web IDE is an interactive web application that Experts use to perform interactive research and to develop algorithms. The Command-line Client builds upon the Client Library to provide a command-line tool that can be used, for example, to automate EP interactions through scripts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Web Portal provides the main user interface for the Exploitation Platform. It would be expected that each platform would provide its own bespoke portal implementation, and so is beyond the scope of the Common Architecture. Nevertheless, the architecture and its service interface must meet the needs anticipated by future exploitation platform implementations. Similarly, the External Application represents web applications (external to the hosting environment of the exploitation platform) that use the services of the EP via its Service API and Client Library.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All user interactions with the services of the EP are executed within the context of a given user and their rights to access resources, with associated resource usage billing. Thus, the Identity and Access Management component covers all tiers in this layered model.</p>

<h2 id="mainUserManagement">4. User Management</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the context of the Common Architecture, User Management covers the following main functional areas:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Identity and Access Management (IAM)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Identification/authentication of users and authorization of access to protected resources (data/services) within the EP.</p>

<dd>
<p>Maintenance of details associated to the user that may be needed in support of access management and billing.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are explored in the following sub-sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="IAM">4.1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of IAM is to uniquely identify the user and limit access to protected resources to those having suitable access rights. We assume an Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) approach in which authorisation decisions are made based upon access policies/rules that define attributes required by resources and possessed (as claims) by users. ABAC is is seen as a more flexible approach than Role Base Access Control (RBAC), affording the ability to express more sofisticated authorisations rules beyond the role(s) of the user - and noting the fact that a role-based ruleset could be implemented within an attribute based approach, (i.e. RBAC is a subset/specialisation of ABAC).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In achieving this there are three main concerns:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unique user identification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the access policy applicable to the resource</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the access policy determine:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>what attributes are required to access the protected resource</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether the user has the required attributes</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the Common Architecture, we establish separation of User Identification from Access Management. User identity is federated and handled external to the platform. Within the Network of EO Resources, resources held within an exploitation platform are made available to federated partner platforms. Authorisation policy is enforced within the platform at point of access, but the access policy can be federated within the network of EO resources, leading to a system of <em>federated authorisation</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The identity is provided externally. The external IdP has no association to the exploitation platform, and hence is not the appropriate place to administer attributes that relate to EP resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The protected resources are under the custodianship of the exploitation platform and hence the exploitation platform enforces the access policy decision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The administrative domain for an access policy should should not be tied to an exploitation platform, which facilitates the provision of federation and virtual organisations</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_iam_approach">4.1.1. IAM Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#img_iamOverview">Figure 3</a> presents the basic approach. At this stage it does not consider the case in which an exploitation platform accesses resources in another platform on behalf of a user, (for example a workflow step that is invoked on another platform). This is addressed in a later section. Users are authenticated by redirection to an external identity provider, (their âhomeâ IdP). This returns the authentication decision and some basic user information as required (such as name, email, etc.).</p>
</div>
<div id="img_iamOverview" class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="./images/iam-overview.png" alt="iam overview" width="1000">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 3. Identity and Access Management Overview</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each protected resource is fronted by its Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), which acts as filter that will only permit access if the appropriate conditions are met. This decision is made according to a set of rules that are under the control of and configured within the exploitation platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Login Service is provided as a common component that is utilised by each PEP to perform the authentication flow with the external IdPs. In the case of an unauthenticated request that requires authentication, the PEP will initiate the Login Service by redirection of the Userâs originating request. The successful flow ultimately redirects back to the PEP and so maintains the direct connection between the end-user agent and the resource server. An alternative approach would be the use of an API Gateway to perform the role of the PEP, acting as an intermediary between the end-user agent and the resource server. However, this would have the effect of proxying the connection which can have an impact on data transfer performance, which is of particular importance in the case of significant data volumes being returned to the User.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The PEP interrogates the PDP for an authorisation decision. The PEP sends a request that indicates the pertinent details of the attempted access, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identity of end-user (subject)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The API (path/version etc.) being accessed (resource)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The operation (HTTP verb) being performed (action)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Policy Decision Point (PDP) returns an authorisation decision based upon details provided in the request, and the applicable authorisation policy. The authorisation policy may delegate all or part of the decision to external PDP(s) within the federated network. This represents a Federated Authorisation model and facilitates a model of shared resources and virtual organisations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The authorisation policy defines a set of rules and how they should be evaluated to determine the policy decision. The rules are expressed through attributes. The policy is evaluated to determine what attributes are required, and what attributes the user possesses. This evaluation extends through external PDPs according to any federated authorisation defined in the policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It should be additionally noted that the decision to allow the user access depends upon dynamic 'attributes', such as whether the user has enough credits to 'pay' for their usage, or whether they have accepted the necessary Terms &amp; Conditions for a given dataset or service. Thus, the PDP must interrogate other EP-services such as 'Accounting &amp; Billing' and 'User Profile' to answer such questions.</p>

<h3 id="_authenticated_identity">4.2. Authenticated Identity</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The approach to user identity and authentication centres around the use of OpenID Connect. Each Exploitation Platform maintains their own OIDC Provider through which tokens can be issued to permit access to protected resources within the EP. The authentication itself is delegated to external Identity Providers at the preference of the end-user wishing to reuse their existing identity provision.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_overview">4.2.1. Overview</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Login Service is an OpenID Connect Provider that provides a âLogin Withâ service that allows the platform to support multiple external identity providers. The Login Service acts as a Relying Party in its interactions with the external IdPs to establish the authenticated identity of the user through delegated authentication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Login Service presents an OIDC Provider interface to its clients, through which the OIDC clients can obtain Access Tokens to resources. The access tokens are presented by the clients in their requests to resource servers (intercepted by PEP). The PEP (acting on behalf of the resource server) relies upon the access token to establish the authenticated identity of the users making the requests. Once the user identity is established, then the PEP can continue with its policy decision (deferred to the PDP).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, clients of the EP must act as OIDC Clients in order to authenticate their users to the platform, before invoking its services. Clients include the web applications that provide the UI of the exploitation platform, as well as other external applications/systems (including other exploitation platforms) wishing to use the services of the EP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Login Service must act as client (Relying Party) to each of the External IdPs to be supported and offered as a âLogin Withâ option. The interface/flow with the External IdP is integrated into the OIDC flow implemented by the Login Service. This includes prompting the user to discover their âhomeâ Identity provider. The interactions with the external IdP represents the âuser authentication stepâ within the OIDC flows. Completion of a successful authentication with the external IdP allows the Login Service to issue the requested access tokens (depending on the flow used).</p>

<h4 id="_oidc_id_token">4.2.3. OIDC ID Token</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ID Token is a JWT that is returned to from the /userinfo endpoint of the Login Service. The returned OIDC ID Token has been signed (JWS) by the Login Service and thus results in a token that asserts a userâs authenticated identity with integrity, and non-repudiation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_oidc_clients">4.2.4. OIDC Clients</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clients are Relying Parties that act on behalf of users accessing the services of the Exploitation Platform. They will either pre-emptively obtain their access token for required resources, or will attempt resource access and be redirected by exception to the OIDC Provider authentication flow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the case of a web application (browser hosted), the Implicit Flow would be used. In other cases (TBD) the Authorisation Code Flow would be preferred.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OIDC flows are initiated with the appropriate response_type (âid_token tokenâ for Implicit Flow, âcodeâ for Authorisation Code Flow) and scope of âoidc profileâ.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the successful conclusion of the flow the client receives the Access Token and ID Token. The Access Token is then used by the client as a Bearer token in its subsequent calls to access the EP resources.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_pep_resource_server_filter">4.2.5. PEP (Resource Server filter)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The PEP (acting on behalf of the resource server) receives the client request to access the protected resource. In the case that the access requires an authenticated user, then the PEP expects that the request includes a valid access token.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, the PEP follows the logic:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The PEP checks with the PDP whether an authenticated user is required for access</p>

<li>
<p>If no authenticated user is required then the request can continue (pending authorisation) as an 'anonymous' user</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If access requires an authenticated user then</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the access token is not present then no user is logged in, so the request should be redirected to the /authorize endpoint (HTTP redirect)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the access token is present, then it should be validated with the Login Service (direct call), as described below</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the access token validation completes successfully then the request can continue (pending authorisation), with the user identity provided by the ID Token received during token validation</p>

<h4 id="_access_token_validation">4.2.6. Access Token Validation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The PEP validates the access token by using it as a Bearer token in a request to the Login Serviceâs /userinfo endpoint. A successful response has two outcomes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Confirms the validity of the access token from the point-of-view of the Login Service that issued it</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ID Token is a JWT that has been signed by the Login Service. Using the jwks (see section âOIDC Federationâ) endpoint of the Login Service, the PEP is able to obtain the necessary keys to validate the signature of the ID Token. This provides the full user context for the resource access.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_federated_user_access">4.2.7. Federated User Access</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based upon the above authentication model, an EP could access the resources of another EP by obtaining an access token through OIDC flows. However, considering that these EP&#8594;EP invocations will typically be Machine-to-machine (M2M), then we need to consider how the end-user (resource owner) is able to compete their consent. Two possibilities are explored in the subsequent sections:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The user pre-authorises the EP&#8594;EP access in advance of the operation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of OIDC JWKS for trusted federation of identity between platforms</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_user_pre_authorisation">User Pre-authorisation</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using the facilities of the Exploitation Platform, the user (perhaps via their User Profile management console) initiates the authorisation flow from one EP to another. The end result is that the originating EP obtains delegated access to another EP on behalf of the user - with the resulting access tokens being maintained within the user&#8217;s profile on the EP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the point where the EP needs to access a resource on another EP, then the access tokens are obtained from the user&#8217;s profile and used as Bearer token in the resource request to the other EP. Refresh tokens can be used to ensure that authorisation is long-lived.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conversly, the user&#8217;s profile at a given EP should also provide the ability to manage any inward authrosations they have granted to other EPs, i.e. ability to revoke a previous authorisation by invalidating the refresh token. This would invole interface with the Login Service.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_possible_use_of_oidc_jwks_federation">Possible use of OIDC JWKS Federation</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OIDC provides a distributed key-hierarchy that could be used to support federated user access between collaborating exploitation platforms. The concept is explored in this section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reference: <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html" class="bare">https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OIDC provides a framework in which RPs and OPs can dynamically establish verifiable trust chains, and so share keys to support signing and validation of JWTs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dedicated âfederationâ endpoints are defined that allow an entity (such as RP or OP) to publish their own Entity Statements, and to obtain Statements for other entities that are issued by trusted third-parties within the federation. The metadata/signatures within the Entity Statements establish a chain of trust that can be followed to known (trusted) Trust Anchors, and so the Entity Statements and the included entity public keys can be trusted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, through this mechanism public keys can be shared to underpin the signing and validation of JWTs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within an EP, when a resource server is executing a userâs request, it may need to invoke a resource in another EP with which it is collaborating. The resource access to the other EP must be made on behalf of the originating user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The nominal solution is for the originating EP to act as an OIDC Client to interface with the Login Service of the other EP, and so obtain the access token required to access the other resource. In this case, we should consider the fact that the resource access may be asynchronous to the end-user request and is not made within the context of the end-userâs user agent. Therefore, we should explore possibilities (flows) provided by OIDC/OAuth that support this type of access.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One possibility is to make use of the signed-JWT ID Token that can be carried through the calls into and across resource servers. Through the facilities provided by JSON Web Key Set (JWKS), ID Tokens can be verified and trusted by other platforms operating within the same JWKS key hierarchy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, using the trusted ID Token, it may be possible follow an OIDC/OAuth flow from one EP to another, in which the user is deemed to have a-priori authorised the third-party access. At this point it is only the userâs identity that has been established, with the authorisation decision subject to the rules of the PDP/PEP of the remote system. The identified user must have appropriate a-priori permissions (attributes) on the target resources to be granted access, (ref. âFederated Attributesâ).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, it is the ID of the user that has been passed machine-to-machine to facilitate the service federation. This effectively achieves cross-EP single sign-on, without relying upon the user agent of the end-user providing cookies to the other EP.</p>

<li>
<p>Discovery of the OpenID Provider Issuer based upon the userâs identifier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discovery of the OpenID Provider Configuration Information</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the case of our usage within the Exploitation Platform, type 1) is not application since the userâs ID comes from their âHomeâ organisation and is not (necessarily) tied to an OpenID Connect Provider. Instead the Login Service must implement a discovery âflowâ in which the user is able to select the provider of their identity, as one that is supported by the Login Service deployment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regarding discovery type 2), the Login Service exposes an OIDC Provider interface, and this should support retrieval of OIDC Provider Configuration Information. Thus, OIDC Clients can utilise the discovery interface of the Login Service to exploit its services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is of most interest in the case of access to federated resources in other EPs, where a resource server in one EP may be acting as an OIDC client of the Login Service in another EP â in which case auto-discovery might be more attractive.</p>

<p>The platform must account for resource use both within the platform and in other platforms via federation. In additional, several inter-platform billing models are supported as defined in the use cases, <a href="#EOEPCA-UC">[EOEPCA-UC]</a>. A number of principles must first be established:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Actions are performed within the context of a 'billing identity', which may be different to the user&#8217;s identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charges are the result of discrete 'billing events' occuring within a particular 'billing window'. Pricing must consider all events within the window, not events individually (to support, for example, tiered pricing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Different platforms may follow completely different pricing and billing models. The architecture and federation messaging can not assume any particular method of calculation or for describing prices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only the platform hosting it can accurately price the use of a licensed Resource or compute resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Costs may be estimated but the estimate is not required to be binding. Federated access can never rely on binding estimates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Debts can only be created where there is a direct contractual relationship and opportunity for credit control. A user can never owe money directly to another platform unless he has an account with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A platform prices in a single currency (but could choose to allow a user to settle a bill with another currency). Different federated platforms may choose different currencies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_billing_identities">4.3.1. Billing Identities</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A billing identity is a user identity for a user who has established a billing relationship with the platform. A billing user may delegate chargeable service access to other users within the system, permitting that user to use resources billed to the billing identity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inidividual platforms may choose models with varying complexity. For example, one platform may require that the billing and user identity are always the same, whilst another may permit a user working on multiple cross-organizational projects to choose the billing identity to use. Identities may be related to organizations, projects, etc, for access control and credit control purposes - but these relationships are not required by the architecture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As required by their purpose, cross-platform messaging will include both the user id and the relevant billing identity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_billing_service">4.3.2. Billing Service</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Billing Service will operate within the platform which receives reports of billing events from other components. These are recorded against the relevant billing identity. Billing events have arbitrary attributes defined in them, which the billing service does not interpret (but are sufficient for the pricing engine, see below), a transaction ID identifying the original user action which caused it, and enough additional information for display to the user. Some example billing events might be:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>1 hour of extra-large-vm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>12 CPU-hours of container execution time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>licence for satellite image x</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>execution cost of $x from federated platform y</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Individual components decide when to generate billing events - for example, compute cost billing events may be generated every hour. Billing events may have a start and end or a single time - events with a start and end may be split to keep them within a single billing window.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Billing Service can generate reports for the user. This may involve combining billing events in to line items, such as consolidating VM use in to the number of hours so far this month.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Billing Service will generate bills for each billing window by pricing complete windows. Fixed prices are assigned and recorded at this point. It may also keep track of and, where supported by the platform, initiate payments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To support the PDP and other services, the Billing Service may be required to periodically assess the account&#8217;s standing and make decisions on the acceptibility of resource use. This depends on the billing model in use but could involve checking that credits are not exhausted, checking that a reasonable credit limit has not been reached and the detection of potentially fraudulent behaviour. An account which is no longer in good standing may result in API requests for resource use being denied, or it may result in termination messages being sent in response to billing events.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where billing events are reported in another currency, as may happen with federated resource use, the Billing Service must determine the time and rate for currency exchange.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_pricing_engine">4.3.3. Pricing Engine</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To maximize reusability price calculation is separated in to a different service (but not necessarily a different address space). Given access to a price database describing current, future and past configured prices, a Pricing Engine is otherwise stateless and can:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Given a list of billing events or consolidated line items within a pricing window return calculated rates and prices for each one. For some pricing models this may involve multiple charges for each item or may contain blended rates/prices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return estimated prices for estimated resource use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where a platform wished to provide such a service to users, return price information and estimated prices in response to API requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given a commercial license billing event, calculate the charge to the user, the credit to the Licenser and the platform fee.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_commercially_licensed_resources">4.3.4. Commercially Licensed Resources</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users may publish Resources which are licensed to others on commercial terms and use the platform to collect payments. There are two types of charges which require support within User Management: time-based and volume-based.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Time-based charges occur when a user requests a licence which costs a fixed price for a fixed time, regardless of the accesses made to the Resource. The Data Access Services and Execution Management Services determine when such a licence is required and manage the process for buying one. However, once complete, the purchase must be reported as a billing event and the licence stored in the User Profile. The Billing Service has the opportunity to reject the purchase at this step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Volume-based charges occur as access to a licensed Resource proceeds or completes (for example, on first access to a specific satellite image or for each input image passed to a commercial machine learning model). Again, the DAS or EMS must report these as billing events.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pricing is specified by the Licenser (in a particular form supported by the platform) and stored by the Resource Manager. The DAS/EMS must supply the pricing data in the billing event. The Billing Service then stores three billing events: a charge to the user, a credit to the Licenser and a charge to the Licenser representing the platform fee for handling payment processing.</p>

<p>Three different models for federated availability of commercial services are supported, two of which require support from the accounting and billing mechanisms of the platforms involved. This support comes in the form of inter-platform payments, allowing users to pay for executions or Resource licences which are located elsewhere in the federation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that <em>three</em> platforms may be involved in providing a chargeable federated commercial service:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The home platform where the user is registered and the action is initiated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The host platform where the licenced Resource or chargeable compute resource is located.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The compute platform where processing occurs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider, for example, a processing chain invoked on the home platform which invokes a processing service running on the compute platform using a software container published by a Licenser registered on the host platform. Frequently, two or more of these platforms are the same. However, even if all three are the same the platform may wish to use the same process where payments to a Licenser are involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_inter_platform_payment_model_and_process">Inter-platform Payment Model and Process</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An inter-platform payment supports a User of one platform paying for a service provided by either another platform or by a User of another platform. It&#8217;s important to repeat that a debt is only ever created between two entities which have a legal relationship and an opportunity for credit control. This requires that inter-platform payments involve two or three separate debts being: one from User to home platform, one from home platform to the host platform and the third from the host platform to the User providing the service (if any). The process must also cope with the price not being known in advance in all cases - processing costs in particular may be unpredictable. To support this, the following stages are involved:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Authorization stage</strong>: This provides an opportunity for credit control decisions in advance of debts being incurred. This establishes a maximum amount of debt before a new authorization must be sought or the operation aborted but will not necessarily ever be owed in full. Both home and host platform must agree to authorize an inter-platform payment (the host platform may reject if it doesn&#8217;t believe the home platform will pay). The home platform may 'hold' some account credit from its user or authorize a credit card payment if appropriate in its billing model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clearing stage</strong>: This occurs after a debt is legally incurred, such as after (some of) the computation or data access is completed. The platform on which the service is provided, the host platform, reports to the home platform how much debt has actually been incurred. It may happen in stages - for example a large authorization may occur, followed by the clearing of smaller amounts after every hour of compute time. It cannot exceed the amount authorized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Settlement stage</strong>: This involves a batch of multiple payments, such as a day or a month of payments. The platforms with payment processing contracts in place must reconcile their records and calculate a net amount owed (potentially in multiple currencies). They must then settle the net debt by making a payment using the banking system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two different commercial models are supported: bilateral clearing and central clearing. In bilateral clearing every platform must negotiate a contract with every other platform (or as far as possible - incomplete coverage will limit what users can do). This has certain commercial downsides, such as a need for every-pair auditing for accurate reporting of resource use and a danger of incumbents excluding new entrants. In central clearing a clearing house must exist and all platforms form a relationship with the clearing house. The clearing house technical functionality is not further explored here, nor is the management of counterparty risk. The messaging and process is intended to be the same in both models.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where inter-platform payments are used the host platform is acting a subcontractor to the home platform. Should the host platform fail to perform, a dispute resolution process must be used. This is considered out of scope of the architecture, except that payments may be marked as disputed, refunded or charged back. This must be accounted for during reconciliation between platforms.</p>

<h4 id="_federated_commercial_services_without_inter_platform_payments_direct_payments">4.3.7. Federated Commercial Services Without Inter-platform Payments: Direct Payments</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If inter-platform payments are not available, for example because two platforms do not have a payment agreement, it may still be possible to provide services across multiple platforms providing the user has an account and billing relationship with each one directly. This requires that both platforms recognize both the user and the selected billing identity, and that the billing user has delegated access to the user in both platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To handle direct payments the user must authorize the home platform to act on its behalf when submitting requests to the host platform. This is done using oAuth. The home platform must redirect the user to the host platform which then returns an authorization token to the home platform. Federated platforms must run an oAuth endpoint for this purpose and certain restrictions must be put on its functioning (for example on refresh token lifetime).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other system components must then use an access token when making requests to the host platform. The host platform should still report costs and identifiers to the home platform, which must be passed to the Billing Service to be recorded. This aids dispute resolution and the reporting of total costs for particular requests.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="_relationship_to_system_components">4.3.9. Relationship to System Components</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Billing Service handles inter-platform payments and supports direct payments in response to requests from other components, such as the EMS. The direct payment model is very different to inter-platform payments but knowledge of the distinction and when each should be used should be isolated in the Billing Service as much as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To support this for volume-based charges, interaction between other system components and the Billing Service proceeds as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prior to federated resource use, a component must make a request to the Billing Service with the estimated cost (or a fixed value if not available) and the identity of the host platform. It must also include the transaction ID for the user action which resulted in the payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Billing Service determines what kind of payment handling is available, if any. It returns success or failure and, optionally, an oAuth URL to authorize direct payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The component proceeds with its activity, incurring charges. The activity occurs on the compute platform, which may also be the home or host platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The compute platform seeks authorization from the host platform before charges are incurred. The host platform checks that an authorized payment exist (directly between the home and host platform). If the charge is for compute resources then these are the same platform and may be a no-op, but this may not be the case for computation using licensed data or software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the compute platform seeks access from a host platform which has no authorized payment in place then it must report this to the home platform. The home platform may then request authorization or abort the processing. This may happen if the home platform cannot fully predict the accesses made during computation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The compute platform computes, incurring charges. The compute platform may also access the host platform to retrieve data or software but this may also be cached. The resource use is reported by the compute platform to the host platform - for example, a list of images accessed or processed. This happens in multiple chunks when charges are incurred over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The host platform clears pieces of the original inter-platform authorization by sending a clearing request directly to the home platform. Note that only the host platform is considered authoritative for calculating the true cost (which is returned here).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the original authorization is exhausted then the home platform may pre-emptively extend it by creating a new payment (with the same transaction ID). Otherwise the host platform must reply to a charge report from the compute platform with a response prohibiting further charges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On receiving such a message the compute platform must suspend further processing and forward the response to the home platform. The home platform must then either seek a new authorization or send an abort message to the compute platform.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For time-based licences the flow can be simpler:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The component requests payment authorization from the Billing Service, specifying an exact price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The component communicates with the host platform to acquire the licence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The host platform sends a payment clearing message to the home platform Billing Service to clear the entire authorization.</p>

<h2 id="mainProcessingAndChaining">5. Processing and Chaining</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Processing &amp; Chaining domain area must provide an extensible repository of processing functions, tools and applications (referred here generically as âprocessing servicesâ) that can be discovered by search query, invoked individually, and utilised in workflows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Processing services are published in an Application Catalogue that acts as a Marketplace and facilitates their discovery. Via the Marketplace users have a single point of access to all processing services that are published across the federated system. In order to invoke processing services and workflows, users must specify the data inputs and parameterisation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users must be able to define and execute workflows that chain processing steps, in which the input(s) of a step are provided by the output of preceding step(s). Users can publish workflows as new processing services, and so the possibility of workflow nesting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A workflow comprises multiple steps (processing service invocations), each of which can be executed on the platform that is closest to the data. Thus, the workflow must be orchestrated to invoke the steps on the appropriate platform and stage in/out the data between platforms along the execution pipeline. Thus, processing services should be relocatable between federated EO platforms, such that they can be deployed and instantiated for execution âclose to the dataâ. This implies that applications are packaged in a way that is self-contained, standardised and agnostic of the underlying hosting technology.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users must be able to develop and integrate their own processing services into the platform. Once integrated the user can publish their processing service so that it is discoverable by search query and available in the federated marketplace â and hence available for exploitation by other users, including use in workflows. In support of this, an integrated development environment should be provided that allows users to develop, test and debug their applications before submission.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The interface between the Processing Framework and the compute resource should be abstract so that the solution is not tied to any particular provider (cloud, DIAS, etc.).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In meeting these requirements the following key challenges are identified:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Processing and data interoperability must be established through clear and consistent metadata definitions, to ensure that type mismatches are avoided. This is particularly challenging across federated systems where it becomes more difficult to enforce use of common profiles and vocabularies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defining an application packaging approach whose paradigm is easy to work with, whilst providing a rich environment that allows expert users to exploit the full compute capability of the platform</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation of processing services across the network of EO resources, such that processing implementations can be made available âon-demandâ amongst federated platforms, to facilitate the movement of the âprocessing to the dataâ. Use of a common packaging format that is agnostic of underlying host characteristics is key to this challenge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enforcement of access controls to processing and data resources through multi-step federated workflows requires the userâs ârequest contextâ to be carried through all layers of the request fulfilment. At each point of resource access, the userâs identify and access rights must be asserted. The service interface standards, (such as WPS, CSW, WCS, etc.), must be evaluated and necessary enhancements identified to ensure that the userâs access envelope is respected</p>

</ul>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_solution_overview">5.1. Solution Overview</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Processing &amp; Chaining solution is based upon the work performed in the OGC Testbeds, described by the following Engineering Reports:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, the current OGC Testbed-15 Thread-2 Earth Observation Process and Application Discovery (EOPAD).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Processing-services are packaged as Docker images, which can then be deployed as self-contained applications within the Exploitation Platformâs processing framework. OGC-WPS provides a standard interface to expose all processing services (and workflows) for invocation by WPS clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each processing service is described by an Application Descriptor, which is a file that accompanies its deployment to the processing framework of the EP. The Application Descriptor provides all the metadata required to accommodate the processor within the WPS service and make it available for execution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The architecture is defined by the following main components:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Execution Management Service (EMS)</dt>
<dd>
<p>WPS-T (REST/JSON) service that provides an umbrella orchestration service to deploy/invoke processing services within the ADES of the appropriate (close to data) Exploitation Platform. Thus, the EMS is responsible for the orchestration of workflows, including the possibility of steps running on other (remote) platforms, and the on-demand deployment of processors to local/remote ADES as required.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Application Deployment and Execution Service (ADES)</dt>
<dd>
<p>WPS-T (REST/JSON) service that incorporates the Docker execution engine, and is responsible for the execution of the processing service (as a WPS request) within the âtargetâ Exploitation Platform (i.e. one that is close to the data). The ADES relies upon the EMS to ensure that the processor is deployed as a WPS service before it is invoked.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Application Catalogue</dt>
<dd>
<p>An Application Catalogue provides an inventory of processing services that acts as a Marketplace for the discovery and browse for processing services. The Application Catalogue provides a service that can be searched by facet/keyword and provides supporting metadata and information.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, each platform that supports processing should include an ADES, and each platform that supports workflow orchestration should additionally include an EMS.</p>

<p>In order for processing services and their data input/outputs to be aligned a formalism is required to describe the data types for M2M consumption. This is required to ensure that a processor is invoked with compatible data inputs, its outputs are understood, and that coherent workflows can be constructed in which the outputs &#8594; inputs are aligned. For this purpose, Common Workflow Language (CWL) is used in the Application Package Description to describe the processor input/ouputs.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Application Catalogue is the subject of the current Testbed-15 through which the Data Model and catalogue Service Interface are being explored.</p>

<p>For the Expert User with a service/application to execute in the EP, we might consider three levels of integration:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Importing</strong><br>
The service/application is packaged (unchanged) as a black-box.<br>
Relies upon the stage-in/out of data to the applications existing data access expectations by the Processing Framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adapting</strong><br>
The service/application is adapted (modified) to use the data access interfaces offered by the Common Architecture.</p>

<h3 id="procK8s">5.2. Resource Layer (Infrastructure) Interface</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Processing &amp; Chaining has significant points of interface with the hosting infrastructure for provision of scalable compute resource and access to data for input/output. The definition of this interface should be agnostic of the infrastructure provider onto which the Exploitation Platform is deployed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kubernetes provides an infrastructure abstraction layer that allows the EP to be architected in a way that is agnostic to the underlying hosting infrastructure â the only requirement being the existence of a K8s cluster in which to deploy and run the platform. This abstraction provides points of interface for:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>System deployment</p>

<p>Execution of processing services and applications</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, the Processing &amp; Chaining solution is designed to utilise a Kubernetes Cluster, whose API provides the means to invoke the WPS processing services as docker containers, and also provides the means to support stage-in/out of data for the process execution.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This has particular impact on the ADES, as described in <a href="#ADES">[ADES]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="_application_packaging">5.3. Application Packaging</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Application Package provides a platform independent and self-contained representation of a software item, providing executable, metadata and dependencies such that it can be deployed to and executed within an Exploitation Platform. Typically, in the context of the exploitation platform, the application is an EO data processing algorithm or a workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Application Package allows the application to be exchanged in an interoperable way on any platform within the EP ecosystem. Additionally, the developer of the package need only concern themselves with conformance to the package specification and need not concern themselves with the infrastructure details of any particular EP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Application Package comprises two main parts:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Application Descriptor - metadata descriptor file</p>

<li>
<p>Application Artefact â i.e. the âsoftwareâ component that represents to the execution unit</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In accordance with the approach advocated in OGC Testbed-14 (ref. zzzER), the Application Descriptor is encoded in accordance with the WPS-T DeployProcess document defined by WPS-T JSON encodings (ref. zzz). In this way, the Application Descriptor broadly provides the following details:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A link to the application execution unit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A description of the applicationâs inputs and outputs</p>

<li>
<p>Other auxiliary information</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The EMS provides a Transaction WPS 2.0 (WPS-T) interface, with REST/JSON encodings, as described in section <a href="#_wps_t_restjson">WPS-T REST/JSON</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WPS-T extends standard WPS by adding DeployProcess and UndeployProcess operations. Once a process has been deployed to a WPS then the existing wps:Execute operation remains applicable for execution in the standard way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The EMS provides a WPS-T (REST/JSON) interface that provides an umbrella orchestration service to deploy/invoke processing services within the ADES of the appropriate (close to data) Exploitation Platform. Thus, the EMS is responsible for the orchestration of workflows, including the possibility of steps running on other (remote) platforms, and the on-demand deployment of processors to local/remote ADES as required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The description in this section refers to the WPS operations: GetCapabilities, DescribeProcess, Execute, GetStatus, GetResult, DeployProcess, UndeployProcess. See <a href="#_wps_t_restjson">WPS-T REST/JSON</a> for a mapping of these operations into the REST/JSON encoding.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The EMS provides the endpoint for the userâs web client, through which applications and workflows are deployed to the EMS to make them available for execution.</p>
</div>

<p>Workflows are deployed to the EMS where the steps of the workflow reference applications that are known to the EMS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As illustrated in <a href="#img_procEmsExecute">Figure 11</a>, the EMS orchestrates the workflow execution by invoking the steps as subordinate invocations of wps:Execute at the ADES identified at time of task invocation. The EMS uses wps-t:DeployProcess on the target ADES to ensure that the process is registered before execution.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>At time of <code>wps:Execute</code> the input data must be specified by the invoking user. Two possibilities are currently identified, both of which should be supported by EMS:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Direct URL references to specific data products, accessible through data access service endpoints (such as WCS, WFS, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OpenSearch query parameters that identify the data characteristics as a combination of Collection/AOI/TOI</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In case 1) the EMS can simply pass-through the input arguments to the ADES WPS-T.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In case 2) the EMS must resolve the input data by OpenSearch catalogue queries with the provided parameters. The OpenSearch catalogue end-point can either be defined by the application (in its Application Descriptor), or defined as a parameter of the <code>wps:Execute</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In either case, the end result is that the EMS resolves the input specification to a set of data products URLs that can be passed on to the ADES for execution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The EMS requires a means to determine the target platform (ADES) for the execution, i.e. typically the one closest to the data. In the case of the OGC Testbeds, this determination was made as a one-to-one mapping from the collection identified in the input data specification. If collections are identified to be globally unique, e.g. with a namespace prefix that identifies the hosting platform, then this assertion can be reliably made and the target ADES can be derived from the collection ID. Otherwise, the <code>wps:Execute</code> must be parameterised suitably to identify the target ADES.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Performing the orchestration between steps, the EMS must handle the stage-in and stage-out of data. In the simple case, the result URL returned from a step can be directly used as an input URL for the subsequent step. Use of CWL and the accompanying <code>cwl-runner</code> tool should facilitate this orchestration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The end result of the successful execution is to present the output result to the invoking user. The EMS establishes the location of the results within the storage provision of the Exploitation Platform, and interfaces with the EP Workspace component (<a href="#User Workspace">[User Workspace]</a>) to register the result in the userâs workspace. At this point the WPS execution is complete as reported by the <code>wps:GetStatus</code> and <code>wps:GetResult</code>.</p>

<p>The ADES provides a WPS-T (REST/JSON) service that incorporates the Docker execution engine, and is responsible for the execution of the processing service (as a WPS request) within the âtargetâ Exploitation Platform (i.e. one that is close to the data). The ADES relies upon the EMS to ensure that the processor is deployed as a WPS service before it is invoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main responsibilities of the ADES are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

<p><a href="#procK8s">Resource Layer (Infrastructure) Interface</a> introduces the use of Kubernetes (K8s) as the provider agnostic interface to the Resource Layer.

<h4 id="_container_execution">5.5.1. Container Execution</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The work carried out in the OGC Testbeds 13/14, performed the execution of the âpackagedâ processing service by invoking the ârunâ of a docker container in the machine that hosts the WPS-T service. The Common Architecture design builds upon this, by instead invoking the container as a K8s Job that is deployed for execution in the K8s cluster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This approach is consistent with the current Application Package / ADES definition that specifies a docker image for the processing service. As illustrated in <a href="#img_procAdesExecute">Figure 12</a>, the ADES provides a K8s-aware Execution Engine that handles the complexities of constructing the jobs and interfacing with the K8s cluster.</p>

<p>A Kubernetes cluster comprises a set of Nodes. A Node is a worker machine in Kubernetes and may be either a virtual or a physical machine. Each Node is managed by the Master. A Node can have multiple pods, and the Kubernetes master automatically handles scheduling the pods across the Nodes in the cluster. The Master&#8217;s automatic scheduling takes into account the available resources on each Node.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pods are the atomic unit on the Kubernetes platform. A Pod is a Kubernetes abstraction that represents a group of one or more application containers. A Pod always runs on a Node. The containers in a Pod share an IP Address and port space, are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context on the same Node.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each WPS processing task will be constructed as a Pod and invoked as a dedicated K8s Job. A Job creates one or more Pods to perform a given task. The Job object takes the responsibility of Pod failures. It makes sure that the given task is completed successfully. Once the task is over, all the Pods are terminated automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kubernetes provides Namespaces, which are an abstraction that supports multiple virtual clusters on the same physical cluster. It may be interesting to explore the use of K8s Namespaces for the purpose of establishing a sandboxed execution environment for each task execution.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_data_stage_inout">5.5.2. Data Stage-in/out</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is need for the Processing Framework (ADES) to prepare the inputs before job invocation, and collect the outputs at the job conclusion. The processing task is invoked as a Docker container. In doing so, the container execution environment must be provisioned with the input data for the task, and with the means to âexportâ its outputs to the processing orchestration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The work carried out in the OGC Testbeds 13/14 relied upon use of mounted volumes within the processing task docker container. These mounted volumes present the input data, and receive the output data, as âlocalâ file system access from the point of view of the running container and the processor running within. Use of mounted volumes is equivalently supported by K8s, and is an approach that is relied upon for many (existing) applications that are capable only of accessing data through POSIX file-system interfaces.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, for Mounted Volumes, the approach is to use standard container volumes that present as well-identified directories within the container. The input data is provided in a read-only input directory that mounts into the container hosting infrastructure. Similarly, an empty writable directory is presented for the processing to write is outputs, to be collected by the Processing Framework.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless, we might envisage that access to the underlying data will be provided by the hosting platform through a variety of data access protocols, including: Object Store (S3/Swift), OGC (WMS, WMTS, WFS, WCS, WCPS), OPeNDAP, plus local file-system as mentioned above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The processing framework must establish an environment in which the data access capabilities of the processing service are matched to the data access offering of the platform. There are two possibilities that need to be handled by the Processing Framework:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The processing service / application natively supports the data access protocol, in which case there is no need to stage-in the data. Nevertheless, the Processing Framework must support the pass-through of input data as URL, and the reception of the output(s) as URL. This is facilitated by the utilisation of a <a href="#procDAL">Data Access Library</a> as described below. Also, it must be ensured that any outputs, e.g. to object store, are appropriately directed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The processing service / application does not natively support the data access protocol(s) offered by the underlying platform storage, e.g. the processing service only supports local storage (mounted volume), in which case the Processing Framework must facilitate access to the data on behalf of the processing service.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Solutions to the above are explored in the following <a href="#procDataAccess">section</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="procDataAccess">5.5.3. Data Access</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In cases where the processing service does not natively support the data access protocols offered by the underlying platform, the processing framework must facilitate acces to platform data in a form that can be consumed by the processing service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To support this, the service/application should declare the data access protocol that it requires. This declaration should be made in the Application Descriptor (ref. Application Package), and is selected from a standard set of protocols, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>AWS S3 Object Store</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swift Object Store (OpenStack)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OGC data access services:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Web Map Service (WMS)</p>

<p>Mounted Volume (local storage)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The platform implementation must then ensure that the data interface is presented to the processing container in accordance with its descriptor. It is the job of the platform implementation to translate from the back-end data access protocol to that required by the container. There are a number of techniques that can be employed by the processing framework to facilitate this data access mediation:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Local File-system Stage-in/out</dt>
<dd>
<p>The processing framework must perform the data retrieval to stage-in the data for presentation through a mounted volume as local file-system access. At the conclusion of the processing the outputs must be marshalled into the appropriate platform storage for further consumption, e.g. push to object store.<br>
The approach can be facilitated by use of a FUSE file-system driver to achieve the mediation.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Use of Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Access to the back-end data storage (e.g. HTTP-based) is provided through a user-space driver that presents the remote data as if it were a local directory. For example, using s3fs-fuse (<a href="https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse" class="bare">https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse</a>), access to data in an S3 object store is provided through a FUSE mounted directory. Thus, from the perspective of the processing task, inputs (read) and outputs (write) are accessed through the local file-system interface â satisfying the constraints of the processor.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div id="procDAL" class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Use of Data Access Library</dt>
<dd>
<p>A Data Access Library (DAL) provides an abstraction of the interface to the data. The library provides bindings for common languages (including python, Javascript) and presents a standard programmatic semantic for accessing the data from within the processing service codebase. Specific implementations of the DAL can be made to abstract the data access layer for a given Exploitation Platform. The Processing Framework must support the ability to 'plugin' an alternative implementation of the DAL at processor execution time.<br>
See section <a href="#resourcesDAL">Data Access Library</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Data Access Gateway</dt>
<dd>
<p>Access to the underlying platform data is provided through a common service layer that provides standard data access interfaces that are translated (gateway) to those of the underlying data tier.<br>
For example, to satisfy a processing service that requires an S3 interface, but is executed in an environment where the data is available through a POSIX file system. Minio (<a href="https://github.com/minio/minio" class="bare">https://github.com/minio/minio</a>) is an open source object store implementation that overlays an S3 interface over a POSIX file system.<br>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The work carried out in the OGC Testbeds focused on non-graphical applications, i.e. non-interactive processing functions executing algorithms without intervention. It is also noted that WPS does not facilitate the invocation of GUI-based interactive applications which offer a synchronous experience to the end-user.</p>

<p>That said, the approach to application packaging undertaken in the testbeds does lend itself to the packaging of GUI-based applications, which can be packaged, deployed and executed as docker containers, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Native applications</dt>

<dd>
<p>The web application is delivered through the portal interface of the hosting exploitation platform.</p>
</dd>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In both cases, docker containers offer a good solution to package and deploy the application. At execution time it is necessary to ensure that the appropriate ports are exposed from the running container.</p>

<h3 id="_parallel_processing">5.8. Parallel Processing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OGC Testbeds 13/14 only consider serial processing jobs running in a single Docker container. Here we consider how this approach can be extended to accommodate job requiring parallelisation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One possible approach, is to invoke the processing task as a docker container (as described above), but then within the implementation of this task it makes subordinate invocations that exploit some specific data processing clustering infrastructure available within the platform. For example, the invoked process executes some Python code that then invokes a dask or SLURM cluster to perform the processing work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, the processing task would have a dependency that the Exploitation Platform provides the required data processing technology. In order to resolve this capability dependency the following approach can be made:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The processing service declares within its Application Deployment Package, that it ârequiresâ a particular service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Exploitation Platform declares within the capabilities document output from its WPS endpoint, that it âprovidesâ particular services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The EMS must ensure that the target EP provides the required service of the processing task to be invoked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The parameterisation for the ârequiredâ service are passed to the processing task at invocation</p>

<h2 id="mainResourceManagement">6. Resource Management</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The role of the Resource Management domain is the storage, discovery and access to resources in the Exploitation Platform. In this context, resources primarily refers to data and processing assets. The concerns of processing assets are addressed in the âProcessing &amp; Chainingâ domain area. Thus, Resource Management focuses primarily on the provision of data within the EP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Storage is largely taken care of by the Resource Tier upon which the Exploitation Platform is hosted. The role of the Exploitation Platform is to ensure that the data can be accessed through common data access protocols based upon open standards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is important for:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the end-user wishing to access data directly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>processing services accessing data for input/output</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>other federated Exploitation Platforms accessing each otherâs data and services through well understood interfaces</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To exploit the services of the Platform, users need to discover available data, obtain detailed collection/product information, including the ability to visualise the data in the platform. This applies to data held within the platform, data added by end-users and data produced as the result of processing operations within the platform.</p>
</div>
<div id="img_resourceUseCase" class="imageblock text-center">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 14. Resource Management Use Case</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Processing services and applications are also platform resources that are stored in artefact repositories and must be discoverable by users, including the information required by users to exploit the service. It is assumed that users will store their software artefacts in external public repositories such as DockerHub, GitHub, etc. In the future, it may be necessary for an Exploitation Platform to provide such repository services to its users. Discovery of processing services and applications is met though the âProcessing &amp; Chainingâ domain area by the provision of an Application Catalogue. See <a href="#procAppCatalogue">Application Catalogue</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The inventory and presentation of resources to users must be organised in such a way as to facilitate the discovery and usage of resources in other federated Exploitation Platforms. For example, users must be able to discover data and services in other EPs in order to construct and execute workflows that span multiple federated EPs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Access to resources must be controlled according to the privileges afforded to the logged in user, and appropriate hooks must be established into the EPs accounting and billing subsystems. Thus, the Resource Management services must be implemented according to the approach defined by User Management for authorisation, accounting and billing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the resource holding of the underlying resource tier, the EP maintains a User Workspace in which each user is able to maintain specific data/services of interest to them, and also provides a place to hold results of processing operations. The User Workspace should be provided as a building block of the system that provides this personal inventory. Moreover, the concept can be extended to define Group Workspaces to create a place for sharing and collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Data Ingestion component abstracts the interface to the underlying Resource Tier storage, ensures that incoming data is formatted in accordance with defined standards, is supported by appropriate metadata and directed towards the appropriate dataset collection.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="mainDataCatalogue">6.1. Data Catalogue</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Catalogue provides the user the capability to discover data/products by browse/search, and to obtain details on specific data/products discovered.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_metadata_organisation">6.1.1. Metadata Organisation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The data is organised into Collections, typically representing a dataset. Each collection is composed of multiple granules as files. The catalogue metadata follows a similar organisation and allows the user to discover the data in natural sympathy with this data organisation. Hence, the metadata is presented at the following levels:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Browse Metadata (collection)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Browse metadata is defined at the collection/dataset level. It typically uses ISO19115 records to describe the high-level collection information, such as title, description, spatial<strong>/temporal coverage, list of variables available, access rights, T&amp;Cs, etc.<br>
</strong>For collections, the spatial coverage is often full-earth.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Discovery Metadata (product)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Discovery metadata is defined for each granule (file) comprising the collection. This typically includes information such as file-type(s), spatial/temporal coverage, variable, data access (download) method(s). Much of this information can be obtained from the headers of the individual files â depending on file-type. Thus, the Discovery metadata can in-part be populated automatically from the underlying files.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Archive Metadata (file)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Archive metadata refers to the information that is available in the file header. As described above this can be extracted and published into the Discovery metadata of the catalogue.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_example_usage_with_opensearch">6.1.2. Example Usage with OpenSearch</h4>

<p>This metadata model can be exploited, for example, using OpenSearch:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Initial search is made at the collection level to discover collections/dataset of interest.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Once discovered, the granules can then be exploited by the user, for example as input to a processing request, or downloaded.</p>

<h4 id="_resource_types">6.1.4. Resource Types</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps the most challenging aspect of this is that the Catalogues for both Data and Processing-Services must facilitate the proper construction of processing tasks, to ensure there is a proper match of the data types expected as input to the processing. This extends into the construction of workflows where the data types output by a processing task must match the supported inputs of the next task in the chain. The Catalogue must have a rich and consistent metadata model for both Data and Processing-Services in order to achieve these goals.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_data_access">6.1.5. Data Access</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a direct link between the way the data is described in the Catalogue and how it is accessed by the consumers of the data. This links to the Data Access Services (e.g. WMS. WCS, WFS, etc.) provided by the EP, and the way in which the access links are encoded into the Catalogue. These links must be usable by the data consumers which could be processing services, or users downloading the data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence the contents of the Catalogue reflects the data services offered by the platform, including the underlying resource tier services. Each data Collection is presented in the Catalogue as accessible through one or more data access services, as applicable to the specfic data. The Catalogue must present the data access URLs is such a way that the URL resolves correctly to the underlying data via the providing data access service.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_catalogue_compositionaggregation">6.1.6. Catalogue Composition/Aggregation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Exploitation Platform is designed to be hosted in a compute environment that is close to the data of interest. This means that the typical deployment is made to the likes of DIAS, Public Cloud (such as AWS), or National Research Infrastructure (such as CEDA/JASMIN) â that provide the Resources-tier/infrastructure upon which the EP relies. The Resources-tier provides virtual ICT-infrastructure and data. It is common that the Resources-tier provides their own Catalogue to support the data hosted within.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to ensure a coherent link between data discovery and access, the Exploitation Platform provides its own Catalogue that presents the data holding to be accessed through the available data access services. In doing so it must aggregate the catalogue records of the underlying resource tier, the records of other 'federated' platforms, and the value-added data that is contributed through the actions of users on the EP. Thus the EP provides a Catalgue that is tailored to its service offering to ensure a consistent data access interface that can be relied upon by other EP services, in particular by the executing user analysis functions running within the Processing &amp; Chaining context.</p>

<p>We wish the exploitation platform to expose a public catalogue that provides both the Browse (collection) and Discovery (product) views:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the case where the Resource-tier provides these in a way that is conformant with the architecture then these can be relied upon directly for the exploitation platform</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case where the Resource-tier provides only a suitable Product catalogue, then the Collection catalogue must be provided by the EP, with the granule queries being directed to the back-end catalogue. Alternatively, this could be achieved by harvesting the Resource-tier product catalogue into the EP catalogue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, the EP may provide a Catalogue-shim to ensure that an existing Resource-tier catalogue conforms to the interface demands of the open architecture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, the EP must provide all catalogue aspects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The important point is to ensure that the EP presents interfaces that conform to its defined open standards, and is able to take measures to ensure this is the case. From the perspective of the user of the Exploitation Platform a single Data Catalogue end-point is most desirable. The EP web interface can present a consolidated user view in the case of multiple catalogue end-points. A similar consolidation approach can be applied by the EP programmatic API, which can present a single end-point on behalf of the back-end data catalogues.</p>

We might regard the lowest-common-denominator for data access to be a combination of:<br>
* Local filesystem access<br>
* AWS S3 Object Store</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Through docker/kubernetes we can use mounted 'volumes' to present data through a local filesystem interface.<br>
Through s3fs-fuse we can establish local filesytem mount points to S3 object stores.<br>
The Processing Framework makes use of these capabilities to ensure that data is presented to processing services/applications in a form that they can consume.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, the Data Access Gateway presents an S3 interface as an internal data access abstraction, whilst implementing the data access interface to the infrastructure Resource Tier storage.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="resourcesDAL">6.4. Data Access Library (DAL)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the Data Access Gateway, which operates as an internal service, the Data Access Library (DAL) is provided specifically as a point of integration for processing services and applications. The Data Access Library provides an abstraction of the interface to the data, with bindings for common languages (including python, Javascript) and presents a standard programmatic semantic for accessing the data from within the processing service codebase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Data Access Library can provide an abstraction at two levels:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Protocol abstraction</dt>
<dd>
<p>Standard programmatic semantics are provided for accessing the data (i.e. CRUD operations on data granules), that is agnostic of the underlying platform storage data access protocols. This is a lower level interface that should be applicable to all use cases.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Data Model abstraction</dt>
<dd>
<p>A common object model is defined with programmatic semantics, which provides a higher-level abstraction of the data that hides the details of the underlying storage, files and file-formats. The abstraction accesses and parses the underlying data to present data structure representations within the language bindings. Such an object model would likely be applicable to some, but not all, use cases. In cases where this approach is not applicable, then protocol abstraction provides the fall-back option.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, processing services and applications can be implemented in a âportableâ way that is agnostic to the platform resource-tier storage technology.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Specific implementations of the DAL can be made to abstract the data access layer for a given Exploitation Platform. The library offered to the processing service at runtime must implement the specific data access interface to the resource-tier storage. Hence, the library should not be âhard-codedâ into the processor application package (Docker image). The Processing Framework must support the ability to 'plugin' an alternative (platform-specific) implementation of the DAL dynamically at processor execution time. It may be possible to develop a 'generic' Data Access Library by implementation against the standard (internal) interface provided by the Data Access Gateway. In this case, the platform-specifics regarding data access are borne entirely by the Data Access Gateway.</p>

<h2 id="mainPlatformApi">7. Platform API</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Platform API defines standard interfaces at both service and programmatic levels, with the goal of encouraging interroperation between platforms and providing a consistent and portable programming paradigm for expert users. The Service API and its associated Client Library together present a standard platform interface against which analysis and exploitation activities may be developed, and through which platform services can be federated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Service API represents the public service interfaces exposed by the Exploitation Platform for consumption by its clients. Covering all aspects of the EP (authentication, data/processing discovery, processing etc.), these interfaces are based upon open standards and are designed to offer a consistent EP service access semantic within the network of EO resources. Use of the network (HTTP) interfaces of the Service API is facilitated by the Client Library that provides bindings for common languages (Python, R, Javascript). The Client Library is a programmtic representation of the Service API which acts as an abstraction of the Exploitation Platform and so facilitates the development of portable client implementations.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As illustrated in <a href="#img_clientPortability">Figure 18</a>, code implemented against the Client Library is not tied to a particular Exploitation Platform, but instead can be initialised and executed against any EP that supports the corresponding Service API. The User Service/Application shown in the figure can either be a process running external to the platform (e.g. on the users local platform), or running as a deployed process within the Processing Framework of the platform. It should be noted that the use of the Client Library is not mandatory - instead the application can be developed against the Service API directly.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="mainServiceApi">7.1. Service API</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Service API presented by the Exploitation Platform is largely defined and met by the fundamental data/processing services it offers. There are some additional meta-services that support the clients in the discovery and usage of these core services.

<div class="title">Figure 19. Web Portal: Overview</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The platform should support provision of limited access to unauthenticated (guest) users, in which they can search the marketplace to discover the services and data available, and browse supporting materials. Access to the full capabilities of the platform requires registered users to identify and authenticate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Optionally, a <strong>Content Management System (CMS)</strong> can provide a framework within which the platformâs web presence is hosted. It facilitates the creation of user content that can be linked to data and processing resources in the Resource Catalogue. In addition, the CMS provides out-of-the-box facilities for Wikis, FAQs, forums etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Marketplace</strong> builds a user experience on top of the Resource Catalogue that provides a consolidated inventory of all services and data published within the federated system. The user is presented with the ability to browse and to perform rich search queries to discover items of specific interest. The Marketplace content for a data item can include interactive Data Visualisation, such as providing a WMS viewer that exploits the WMS service provided with the platformâs resource service. This <strong>Data Visualisation</strong> component is re-usable such that it can be used elsewhere in the user experience, for example from the userâs workspace to visualise some processing results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The *User Workspace *provides the environment where users are able to organise data and processing they are interested in, and to manage asynchronous âtasksâ they have submitted into the platform. Thus, they are able to monitor data retrieval and processing requests and obtain the outputs at completion. The facility is also provided for them to publish derived âadded-valueâ outcomes from their workspace into the Resource Catalogue, and so present them in the marketplace.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Experts use the <strong>Workflow Composition</strong> interface to chain and combine multiple processing functions and input data into reusable workflows. The interface allows them to select these resources discovered via the Marketplace, architect and execute their workflow, and ultimately publish it as a reusable processing function that is available to others in the Marketplace.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Experts are able to develop and submit to the EO Exploitation Platform their own custom processing algorithms, tools and applications. The <strong>Processor Development Environment</strong> provides a rich, interactive environment in which processing algorithms and services can be developed, tested, debugged and ultimately packaged so that they can be deployed to the platform and published via the marketplace.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>User Management</strong> provides the functionality associated with user profiles. New users will have the ability to self-register and then manage all aspects of their profile interactively - noting that the intention in the Common Architecture is to delegate User Identity management to external IdPs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Operators</strong> will have access to management interfaces for system monitoring and administration.</p>
