= Domain Areas

The system architecture is designed to meet the use cases as defined in <<EOEPCA-UC>> and <<EP-FM>>. <<EOEPCA-UC>> makes a high-level analysis of the use-cases to identify the main system functionalities organised into domain areas: 'User Management', 'Processing & Chaining' and 'Resource Management'. The high-level functionalities are often met by more than one domain area, and User Management (specifically Identity & Access Management) cuts across all use cases, and forms the basis of all access control restrictions that are applied to platform services and data.

<<img_topLevelArchitecture>> depicts the domain areas as top level component blocks in a Platform ‘A’. The arrows may be read as “uses”, each implying one or more service interfaces.

A potential federation concept is represented by interactions between corresponding blocks in a collaborating Platform ‘B’. The architecture aims to minimise dependencies and is conducive to the principle of subcontracting the implementation to experts in the respective domains. The web portal integrates various client components to form a rich user-facing interface. *The Web Portal is depicted as it has interfaces with the other domain areas - but it is not a priority concern for the Common Architecture. Each exploitation platform would be expected to develop its own web interfaces according to its needs.*

== User Management

_Responsible for all aspects related to user identity, authentication, authorization, accounting and billing in a federated system-of-systems environment._

It provides authentication, authorization and accounting services that are required to access other elements of the architecture, including the processing-oriented services and resource-oriented services. Individual resources may have an associated access and/or charging policy, but these have to be checked against the identity of the user. Resource consumption may also be controlled e.g. by credits and/or quotas associated with the user account. In the Network of EO Resources, a user should not need to create an account on multiple platforms. Therefore some interactions will be required between the User Management functions, whether directly or in directly via trusted third party.

== Processing and Chaining

_Provides access to a variety of processing functions, tools and applications, as well as execution environments in which to deploy them._

Provides a deployment and execution environment for processing tasks, analysis tools and interactive applications. Supports the chaining of processing tasks in workflows whose execution can include steps executed external to the origin exploitation platform. Handles and abstracts the low-level complexities of the different underlying compute technologies, and ensures the compute layer is scaled in accordance with current demand. Provides an integrated development environment to facilitate development of new processing algorithms and applications. Facilitating the network of EO resources by providing a federated interface to other processing services within the wider EO network.

The development and analysis environment provides a platform for the expert user to develop their own processing chains, experiments and workflows. It integrates with platform catalogue services (for data, processing services and applications) for discovery of available published datasets and processing elements. Subject to appropriate controls and permissions, the user can publish their own processing services and results. Workflows can be executed within the context of the processing facility, with the possibility to execute steps ‘remotely’ in collaborating platforms, with the results being collected for the continuation of the workflow.

== Resource Management

_Responsible for maintaining an inventory of platform and federated resources, and providing services for data access and visualisation._

Storage and cataloguing of all persistent resources. First and foremost, this will contain multidimensional geo-spatial datasets. In addition it may include a variety of heterogeneous data and other resources, such as documentation, Docker images, processing workflows, etc. Handles and abstracts the low-level complexities of different underlying storage technologies and strategies. Facilitating the network of EO resources by providing a federated interface to other data services within the wider EO network.

The catalogue holds corresponding metadata for every published resource item in the local platform storage, as well as entries for resources that are located on remote collaborating platforms. Catalogue search and data access is provided through a range of standard interfaces, which are used by the local Web Portal and Processing & Chaining elements and may be exposed externally as web services.

Access to services and resources is controlled according to an associated authorization policy as defined by the IAM approach. This component may interact with corresponding peer components on other platforms - for example to synchronise catalogue entries.

The user has a personal workspace in which to upload files, organise links to resources of interest (services/application/data), and receive/manage results output from processing executions. Shared workspaces for collaboration can be similarly provisioned. The ingestion of new data is controlled to ensure the quality of any published resource, including associated metadata, and to maintain the integrity of the catalogue.

== Platform API

_Defines standard interfaces at both service and programmatic levels._

The Service API and its associated Client Library together present a standard platform interface against which analysis and exploitation activities may be developed, and through which platform services can be federated. The Platform API encourages interoperation between platforms and provides a consistent and portable programming paradigm for expert users.

== Web Portal

_Presents the platform user interface for interacting with the local resources and processing facilities, as well as the wider network of EO resources._

The Web Portal provides the user interface (themed and branded according to the owning organisation) through which the user discovers the data/services available within the platform, and the analysis environment through which they can exploit these resources. It provides a rich, interactive web interface for discovering and working with all kinds of resources, including EO data, processing and documentation. It includes web service clients for smart search and data visualisations. It provides a workspace for developing and deploying processing algorithms, workflows, experiments and applications, and publishing results. It includes support and collaboration tools for the community.

Web Portal integrates together various web service clients that uses services provided by the specialist domains (Processing, Resource, User) on the local platform and collaborating platforms.
